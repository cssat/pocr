## Version 1.2.1
New functions:
- rmd_to_md() for generating md config files from Rmd source
- validate_config() for validating json in config files
- remove_leading_blank_lines() deletes blank lines from top of a file

## Version 1.2
Updated R scripts:
- corrected data documentation formatting
- refactored RODBC input validation in the sp_test function so that it is
  now a standalone function: validate_RODBC_input()
- added new get_portal_app_data() wrapper function and started populating
  pocr with functions to support data portal applications (currently just
  county dashboards supported)
- corrected cr_clean() so that it is now functional (Erik)
- added a function to update OFM data (Mark)
- tidied up import behavior across scripts

Updated R vignettes:
- added vignette folder and updated DESCRIPTION to support vignettes
- added vignette for expanding the get_portal_app_data function
- added vignette explaining the process for updating portal apps and how
  get_portal_app_data is used in that process

## Version 1.1
Updated DESCRIPTION:
- updated package title
- updated creator/maintainer name and expanded contributors

Updated R scripts:
- updated package documentation with new title and explicit imports
- added test function (sp_test) for evaluating whether stored_procedure
  produces functional strings on the local machine
- update_county_data() removed (no deprecation)
- function params reviewed and cleaned for devtools::check() compliance

Update R data:
- seperated joined data files (all data now has a matching .rda; e.g., 
  poc_colors has poc_colors.rda)
- dropped sp_names data object as it has an internal version that is slated
  for deprecation

## Version 1.0
Updated DESCRIPTION:
- updated format/contents to match current best practice 
  (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file)
- expanded authorship field to include contributors
- moved non-critical dependencies to imports
- added relevant URLs
- updated the language to more clearly/accurately describe pocr's current scope

Updated R scripts:
- deprecations identified and moved to deprecations.R with appropriate
  notes and warnings - unless noted below, these were NOT yet removed from
  the package (though renames have their calls passed to the renamed function)
- deprecation process exceptions:
    -- trend_plot and context_plot were completely replaced with updated 
       versions, no intermediate steps
    -- trend_plot2, trend_plot3, and trend_plot_state were removed from the
       package, no intermediate steps
    -- stored_procedure was updated with sp_cr code, sp_cr was deprecated as a
       rename
- deprecations included a switch to standardized function casing - all objects
  are now lower case, camel back (e.g., layOut -> lay_out)
- roxygen2 data documentation definitions collected and moved to data_docs.R
- infix functions collected and moved to custom_operators.R
- all other functions moved to individual R scripts named after the function
  (e.g., stored_procedure() now lives in stored_procedure.R)
- various fixes and updates to function descriptions
- cleaned script formatting to adhere to a more consistent global style
  (PEP 0008 for Python: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), though
  code elements were left alone
  
 Updated R data:
 - added ref_lookup_county_region.rda, along with appropriate documentation in
   data_docs.R

## Version 0.9

Removed some dependencies (brew and plyr), added dplyr. Removed the `n()` 
function so that it won't conflict with `dplyr::n`, and removed `su()` shortcut 
for summary because even I wasn't using it.

Added some nice utility functions, such as `fac.to.num`, which is a shortcut 
for `as.numeric(as.character())`, a binary operator `%coalesce%` to mimic that 
function from SQL Server, `%btwn%`, and prehaps most useful, a `theme_poc()` 
for ggplots and the `layOut` function (stolen from the `wq` package) for 
arranging multiple gggplots.

The old version of `stored_procedure` is still included. When this is updated 
to work with the updated stored procedures, I will bump the version up to 1.0.
